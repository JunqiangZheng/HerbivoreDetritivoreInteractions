# HerbivoreDetritivoreInteractions
A repository for experimental data and code associated with the manuscript: Interactions between herbivores and detritivores develop slowly and conspicuously into feedbacks

The scripts in this repository replicate the statistical and theoretical analysis presented in the above manuscript.

The statistical models are all run in the script Statistical_Analysis.R

The simple model and the comparison with the complex model using model results created elsewhere are run in simpleDCmodel.R

The analysis of the complex model including its fit to the empirical data is conducted in analysis_cluster_data.R

The complex model was run on a cluster. The code sent to the cluster to evaluate temporal and equilibrium dynamics can be found in clustermodel_28March2020.R and cluster_eqm.R, respectively.

The other files contain functions loaded for convenience or a demonstrate of climate data.
