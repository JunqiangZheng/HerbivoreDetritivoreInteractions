Issue with the current model is that the plant root growth doesn't benefit from AG growth, so there is no feedback from AG to root growth that matters for plant in the following year.

Issue with the current model is that two plant species are not coexisting. Need another D-D mechanism to help them coexist, since herbivory is just not doing it.

Got it working with a simple plant LV competition model. Now it works OK, but interaction still pretty weak over 20 years.
