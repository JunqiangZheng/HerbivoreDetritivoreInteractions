Issue with the current model is that the plant root growth doesn't benefit from AG growth, so there is no feedback from AG to root growth that matters for plant in the following year.

Issue with the current model is that two plant species are not coexisting. Need another D-D mechanism to help them coexist, since herbivory is just not doing it.

Got it working with a simple plant LV competition model. Now it works OK, but interaction still pretty weak over 20 years.

In order to account for two plants being about to take more resources, we added plant competition to (1) ensure coexistence was possible and (2) reduce the joint plant biomass down to comparable levels.

Having trouble fitting in the parameter names...issues b.c 5 runs are not lining up.


# Notes March 31 2020

Have a ~174000 runs from the cluster. Model doesn't fit great, actually I think it fit better with fewer runs. Probably worth calculating the feedback size for all these runs and plotting that as parameter uncertainty.
